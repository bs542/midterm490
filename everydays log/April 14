Working on the replicated database making Mahi as master and mine as slave.

first we created ssh connection between the both master and slave. 

make sure the Firewalls should be disabled and abled by slave connection. + Ssh should be turned on for both connections. 

Master slave could take the data but realized that it will not be compatible with hatstandby, Then we thought of using postgreSQL.

we will  be using postgreSQL using the hatstand by mode. 


5:03 pm- going to use postgreSQL

But changed the plan then we used sticked to the master and slave idea And just creating master(mahi) to slave(baljit).

we got that to work but the problem is that 

Master adds data into database and it changes into the slave's database too but it would only work if the master is on.

if the master dies the connection ends. 

then we thought of making master to master so the we can change data on both databses insteas of just one.
