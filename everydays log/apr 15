Now we are going to do master to master because we need access to both databases.

Earlier, Mahi was setup as master and Baljit was setup as slave now we will do vice-versa to so both can have access to database files of each other. 

At 2:31 pm while working on the steps to make the master to master. mahi made a mistake and changed config file to readable only he couldn’t ping anyone so he had to change it. 


Then we decided to change everything and we found this articles	to implement master-master
https://www.interserver.net/tips/kb/master-master-replication-mysql-server/


using that We created the master to master on each others vm's. 


we encountered an issue, Baljits machine was connecting but Mahi’s machine wasn’t connecting.


we ran the "Show slave status"  which was providing this error below:

error connecting to master 'baljit@192.168.191.217:3306' - retry-time: 60 retries: 2 message: Can't connect to MySQL server on '192.168.191.217:3306' (111)
 




In order to solve the port error. we looked online and issue were showing up to be 3306 port error and most of the issues were releated to iptables.


Then ip tables got erased accidentally and 1 master wasn’t connecting to any network now even local host. 

So we restarted the machine and the problem was resloved. 


But the issue of connection was still there.
